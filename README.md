Homework Assignment Week 14


# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

### Important

Be sure to utilize the [MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide](../../Supplemental/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) in order to deploy your assignment.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

## Instructions

#### View setup


     * Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.

```

### Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.
